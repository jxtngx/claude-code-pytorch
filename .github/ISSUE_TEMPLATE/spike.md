## Spike Overview

**Research Question**: [What are we trying to learn or prove?]

**Context**: [Why is this investigation needed?]

## Objectives
- [ ] [Specific question to answer or hypothesis to test]
- [ ] [Technical feasibility to assess]
- [ ] [Risk or uncertainty to resolve]

## Timebox
- **Maximum Duration**: [X days/hours]
- **Sprint**: [Sprint number]
- **Start Date**: [YYYY-MM-DD]
- **End Date**: [YYYY-MM-DD]

## Success Criteria
The spike is successful if we can:
- [ ] Answer the research question definitively
- [ ] Provide recommendation with confidence level
- [ ] Identify risks and mitigation strategies
- [ ] Estimate effort for implementation
- [ ] Create proof of concept (if applicable)

## Research Approach
1. [Investigation step 1]
2. [Investigation step 2]
3. [Investigation step 3]

## Areas to Investigate
- **Technical Feasibility**: [What technical aspects to explore]
- **Performance Impact**: [Benchmarks or metrics to measure]
- **Integration Complexity**: [Systems or components to consider]
- **Alternative Solutions**: [Options to evaluate]

## Deliverables
- [ ] **Research Summary**: Document findings and recommendations
- [ ] **Proof of Concept**: Working prototype or code sample
- [ ] **Decision Matrix**: Comparison of alternatives
- [ ] **Risk Assessment**: Identified risks and mitigations
- [ ] **Story Breakdown**: User stories if moving forward
- [ ] **Effort Estimate**: Story points for implementation

## Constraints
- **Time Limit**: [Strict timebox - do not exceed]
- **Resources**: [Available tools, data, compute]
- **Scope Boundaries**: [What NOT to investigate]

## Questions to Answer
