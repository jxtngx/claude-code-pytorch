## User Story (INVEST Format)

**As a** [role: researcher/developer/user]
**I want to** [desired feature/capability]
**So that** [business/research value]

**Examples:**

1. As a computer vision researcher
   I want to add support for video transformers with temporal attention
   So that I can experiment with action recognition on Kinetics-400

2. As an NLP researcher with limited GPU memory
   I want to add QLoRA fine-tuning integration
   So that I can efficiently adapt large language models on consumer hardware

3. As a training engineer
   I want to add automatic mixed precision training with gradient scaling
   So that I can reduce training time and memory usage by 50%

4. As an ML product manager
   I want to add a real-time model serving dashboard with Gradio
   So that stakeholders can interact with models without writing code

5. As a compute orchestrator
   I want to add distributed data parallel training across multi-node EC2 clusters
   So that I can scale training to datasets larger than single-node memory
