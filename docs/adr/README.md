# Architecture Decision Records

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the Claude Code PyTorch project.

## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences.

## ADR Index

4. Submit for review through standard PR process

## ADR Lifecycle

- **Proposed**: Under discussion
- **Accepted**: Decision ratified and in effect
- **Deprecated**: No longer relevant but kept for historical context
- **Superseded**: Replaced by another ADR (link to the new one)

## Integration with Agile Process

ADRs are reviewed during:
- Sprint planning (for proposed ADRs affecting upcoming work)
- Sprint retrospectives (for lessons learned)
- Architecture reviews (quarterly)
