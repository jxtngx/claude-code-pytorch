"""
Training and evaluation pipeline orchestration for machine learning experiments.

This module coordinates the complete ML workflow, managing training runs,
evaluation processes, and experiment tracking. It serves as the main entry
point for executing experiments with various configurations.

Key responsibilities:
- Orchestrate end-to-end training and evaluation pipelines
- Manage experiment configurations and hyperparameter sweeps
- Coordinate model checkpointing and restoration
- Track and compare experiment metrics across runs
- Handle distributed training coordination
- Generate comprehensive experiment reports
- Ensure reproducibility through configuration management

Integration points:
- Uses trainer.py for training loop execution
- Leverages data.py for dataset and dataloader creation
- Interfaces with network.py for model instantiation
- Coordinates with compute.py for resource allocation
- Integrates with metrics evaluation systems

Typical workflow:
1. Load experiment configuration
2. Initialize data pipelines
3. Create model architecture
4. Execute training with monitoring
5. Perform evaluation on test sets
6. Save checkpoints and artifacts
7. Generate experiment reports
