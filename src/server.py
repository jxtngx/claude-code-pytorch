"""
API server infrastructure and model serving components.

This module implements REST API endpoints for model inference, providing
scalable serving infrastructure for deployed machine learning models.
It handles request processing, batch inference, model versioning, and
integrates with web interfaces for interactive demonstrations.

Key responsibilities:
- REST API endpoint implementation for predictions
- Model loading and warm-up for low-latency serving
- Request validation and preprocessing
- Batch inference optimization for throughput
- Response formatting and post-processing
- Model versioning and A/B testing support
- Health checks and monitoring endpoints

Core components:
- ModelServer: Main serving application class
- run_server(): FastAPI/Flask server initialization
- PredictionEndpoint: Single prediction handler
- BatchEndpoint: Batch prediction processing
- ModelRegistry: Model version management
- RequestValidator: Input validation and sanitization
- ResponseFormatter: Output serialization

API endpoints:
- /predict: Single sample inference
- /batch_predict: Batch inference for multiple samples
- /health: Service health check
- /metrics: Performance metrics and statistics
- /models: Available model versions
- /explain: Model interpretability endpoints

Serving optimizations:
- Model quantization for reduced latency
- TorchScript/ONNX optimization for inference
- Request batching and queue management
- GPU memory pooling and allocation
- Caching strategies for repeated queries
- Load balancing across model replicas

Agent ownership:
- CloudEngineer: API development and cloud deployment
- InterfaceDesigner: Web interface and visualization
