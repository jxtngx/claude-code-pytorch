"""
Neural network architecture design and model instantiation.

This module provides a unified interface for creating and configuring
neural network models, supporting both custom PyTorch architectures and
pre-trained models from HuggingFace. It handles model initialization,
architecture composition, and configuration management.

Key responsibilities:
- Custom neural network architecture implementation
- HuggingFace model integration and fine-tuning setup
- Model factory pattern for configuration-based instantiation
- Architecture search and neural architecture design
- Model compression and optimization techniques
- Transfer learning and domain adaptation strategies

Core components:
- ModelFactory: Configuration-driven model instantiation
- load_pretrained_model(): HuggingFace model loading with custom heads
- CustomVisionModel: Vision-specific architectures (CNN, ViT)
- CustomTextModel: NLP architectures (Transformer, RNN)
- MultiModalModel: Cross-modal architectures for vision-language tasks
- Layer modules: Attention, convolution, normalization components

Integration points:
- HuggingFace transformers for pre-trained models
- timm library for vision model architectures
- torchvision.models for standard computer vision models
- Custom CUDA kernels for optimized operations

Agent ownership:
- NetworkArchitect: Custom architecture design and implementation
- ModelArchitect: HuggingFace model selection and configuration
