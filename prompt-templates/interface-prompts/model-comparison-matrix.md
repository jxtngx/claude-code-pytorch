# Model Comparison Matrix

**User Story:**
As a model evaluator
I want to compare multiple models side-by-side
So that I can select the best model for production deployment

**Prompt:**
"@agent-InterfaceDesigner I need to build a model comparison matrix interface that displays performance metrics, inference speed, model size, and accuracy across different test sets. The interface should include sortable columns, heatmap coloring for metric values, detailed drill-down views, confidence intervals, and export to presentation formats. Please implement radar charts for multi-metric comparison, parallel coordinates for hyperparameters, statistical significance tests, model card generation, and shareable comparison links."

## CONSTRAINTS
- Maximum models: 20 for comparison
- Metrics: Customizable up to 50
- Export formats: PDF, PNG, CSV
- Load time: <1s for 20 models

## REWARDS
- Comprehensive comparison matrix
- Visual metric representations
- Statistical significance testing
- Export and sharing features

## PENALTIES
- No sorting or filtering
- Missing confidence intervals
- Poor handling of missing data
- No responsive design

## GOAL STATE
- Model comparison interface
- Multi-metric visualization
- Statistical analysis
- Export capabilities
