# Model Deployment Monitor

**User Story:**
As a DevOps engineer
I want to monitor ML model deployments in production
So that I can track performance, health, and resource usage across multiple endpoints

**Prompt:**
"@agent-InterfaceDesigner I need to build a model deployment monitoring dashboard that tracks multiple ML model endpoints in production. The interface should display real-time inference latency, throughput metrics, error rates, model drift detection, resource utilization (CPU/GPU/memory), and endpoint health status. Please implement alerting thresholds with visual indicators, historical performance charts, A/B testing comparison views, logs viewer with filtering, and integration with monitoring services like Prometheus/Grafana/DataDog."

## CONSTRAINTS
- Endpoint monitoring: Up to 50 concurrent models
- Metrics refresh: Every 5-30 seconds
- Historical data: 30 days retention
- Alert response: <1 second notification

## REWARDS
- Multi-endpoint monitoring
- Real-time alerting system
- Performance trend analysis
- A/B testing visualization

## PENALTIES
- No alerting system
- Missing historical charts
- Poor handling of offline endpoints
- No mobile responsiveness

## GOAL STATE
- Production monitoring dashboard
- Automated alerting system
- Performance analytics
- Health status overview
