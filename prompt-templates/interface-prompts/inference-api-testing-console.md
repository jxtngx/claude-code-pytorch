# Inference API Testing Console

**User Story:**
As an API developer
I want to test ML model endpoints interactively
So that I can validate API behavior and debug integration issues

**Prompt:**
"@agent-InterfaceDesigner I need to create an API testing console for ML model inference endpoints with support for multiple input formats, authentication methods, and response visualization. The console should provide request builder with syntax highlighting, response formatter with JSON/XML views, latency and throughput metrics, batch request testing, and request history with replay. Please implement cURL command generation, Postman collection export, response diff comparison, mock response mode, and WebSocket endpoint testing."

## CONSTRAINTS
- Request size: Up to 10MB
- History retention: Last 100 requests
- Batch size: Up to 100 requests
- Response time tracking: Microsecond precision

## REWARDS
- Multi-format request builder
- Response visualization
- Performance metrics
- Request history and replay

## PENALTIES
- No authentication support
- Missing batch testing
- Poor error visualization
- No request templates

## GOAL STATE
- API testing console
- Performance monitoring
- Request management
- Integration debugging
