# Experiment Reproducibility Hub

**User Story:**
As a research scientist
I want to track and reproduce ML experiments
So that I can ensure scientific rigor and share reproducible results

**Prompt:**
"@agent-InterfaceDesigner I need to build an experiment reproducibility hub that captures code versions, hyperparameters, dataset versions, environment configurations, and random seeds for ML experiments. The interface should provide experiment comparison tables, dependency graphs, reproducibility checklists, one-click experiment recreation, and integration with version control (Git) and experiment tracking (MLflow, Weights & Biases). Please implement environment diff visualization, dependency conflict detection, experiment cloning workflows, and automated documentation generation."

## CONSTRAINTS
- Version control: Git integration required
- Experiment tracking: MLflow/W&B compatibility
- Environment capture: Docker/conda support
- Storage: Up to 10GB per experiment

## REWARDS
- Complete experiment tracking
- One-click reproduction
- Dependency management
- Automated documentation

## PENALTIES
- No version control integration
- Missing environment capture
- Poor comparison features
- No automated checks

## GOAL STATE
- Reproducibility tracking system
- Experiment comparison tools
- Environment management
- Documentation automation
