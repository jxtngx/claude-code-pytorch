# ML Model Playground Interface

**User Story:**
As a machine learning researcher
I want an interactive web interface for experimenting with model parameters
So that I can visualize predictions and understand model behavior in real-time

**Prompt:**
"@agent-InterfaceDesigner I need to create an interactive ML model playground interface with real-time parameter adjustment, live prediction visualization, and performance metrics display. The interface should handle model selection from a dropdown, hyperparameter sliders with instant updates, input data upload or manual entry, and animated visualizations of predictions. Please implement using the dark theme design system in apps/global.css with CSS custom properties, WebSocket connections for real-time updates, responsive layout for desktop and mobile using CSS Grid/Flexbox, keyboard shortcuts for power users (space for play/pause, arrow keys for parameter adjustment), and export functionality for results and configurations as JSON/CSV."

## CONSTRAINTS
- Framework: Vanilla JavaScript with global.css CSS custom properties
- Real-time updates: <100ms latency via WebSocket
- Browser support: Chrome 88+, Firefox 85+, Safari 14+, Edge 88+
- Mobile responsive: 320px minimum width with touch-friendly controls
- Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with keyboard navigation

## REWARDS
- Real-time parameter adjustment
- Live prediction visualization
- Performance metrics dashboard
- Export/import configurations

## PENALTIES
- No loading states for async operations
- Missing error handling for WebSocket
- Poor mobile experience
- Inaccessible to screen readers

## GOAL STATE
- Interactive playground interface
- Real-time model experimentation
- Performance visualization
- Configuration management
