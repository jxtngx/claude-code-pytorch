# Training Progress Dashboard

**User Story:**
As a data scientist
I want to monitor training progress across multiple experiments
So that I can compare models and make informed decisions about hyperparameters

**Prompt:**
"@agent-InterfaceDesigner I need to build a comprehensive training progress dashboard that displays real-time metrics for multiple concurrent training runs. The dashboard should show loss curves with zoom and pan capabilities, accuracy and validation metrics over epochs, resource utilization (GPU/CPU/memory), estimated time remaining, and comparative views between experiments. Please implement using Chart.js for visualizations, server-sent events for live updates, collapsible experiment panels, metric export to CSV/JSON, and integration with TensorBoard logs."

## CONSTRAINTS
- Update frequency: Every 1-5 seconds
- Maximum concurrent experiments: 10
- Chart performance: 60fps scrolling
- Data retention: Last 1000 epochs

## REWARDS
- Multi-experiment comparison
- Interactive chart controls
- Resource monitoring
- Export capabilities

## PENALTIES
- No data persistence on refresh
- Missing comparison features
- Poor performance with many datapoints
- No mobile optimization

## GOAL STATE
- Live training dashboard
- Multi-run comparison
- Interactive visualizations
- Metric export system
