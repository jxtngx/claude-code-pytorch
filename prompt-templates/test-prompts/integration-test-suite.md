# Integration Test Suite

**User Story:**
As a system architect
I want integration tests for the complete ML pipeline
So that I can ensure components work together correctly

**Prompt:**
"@agent-TestArchitect I need end-to-end integration tests for the complete ML system. Write tests that validate data flows correctly from input to prediction, model training convergence on real data, API endpoints serve trained models correctly, and monitoring captures all metrics. Use torch.testing for ML components, create test fixtures with torch.testing.make_tensor(), and validate the entire pipeline from data loading through inference. Include tests for error propagation, recovery mechanisms, and system resilience."

## CONSTRAINTS
- Pipeline coverage: Data → Training → Serving
- Test data: Synthetic but realistic
- Execution time: <2 minutes
- Resource usage: Single GPU

## REWARDS
- Full pipeline validation
- Component integration tests
- Error propagation checks
- Recovery mechanism validation

## PENALTIES
- Component isolation only
- No error path testing
- Missing integration points
- No resilience testing

## GOAL STATE
- System integration verified
- Data flow validated
- Error handling confirmed
- Production readiness assured
