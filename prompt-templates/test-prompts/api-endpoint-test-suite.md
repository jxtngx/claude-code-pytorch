# API Endpoint Test Suite

**User Story:**
As an API developer
I want tests for ML inference endpoints before implementation
So that I can ensure correct serialization and prediction serving

**Prompt:**
"@agent-TestArchitect I need test suite for REST API endpoints serving ML models. Write tests that validate request/response formats, model loading and caching, batch inference correctness, error handling for malformed inputs, and latency requirements. Use torch.testing for tensor validation in responses, test concurrent requests, memory usage under load, and graceful degradation. Include tests for different input modalities (images, text, tabular) and output format validation (JSON, protobuf)."

## CONSTRAINTS
- Response time: <100ms for single inference
- Batch size: Up to 32 samples
- Concurrency: 100 simultaneous requests
- Memory: Model caching validation

## REWARDS
- Tensor serialization validation
- Concurrency testing
- Memory leak detection
- Latency benchmarks

## PENALTIES
- No load testing
- Missing error handling tests
- Single format testing only
- No memory profiling

## GOAL STATE
- API contract validation
- Performance requirements met
- Error handling verified
- Scale testing passed
