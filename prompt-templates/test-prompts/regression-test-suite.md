# Regression Test Suite

**User Story:**
As a maintainer
I want regression tests that catch breaking changes
So that I can safely refactor and update dependencies

**Prompt:**
"@agent-TestArchitect I need regression test suite to prevent breaking changes in ML components. Write tests using torch.testing that capture current behavior baselines, validate backward compatibility, check for performance regressions, and ensure reproducibility across versions. Include golden tests for model outputs, compatibility tests for saved checkpoints, and performance benchmarks with acceptable variance thresholds. Use torch.testing.assert_close() with appropriate tolerances for numerical stability."

## CONSTRAINTS
- Compatibility: Last 3 versions
- Performance variance: <5%
- Numerical tolerance: 1e-5
- Checkpoint formats: All supported

## REWARDS
- Golden output validation
- Version compatibility tests
- Performance tracking
- Reproducibility checks

## PENALTIES
- No baseline capturing
- Missing compatibility tests
- No performance tracking
- Hardcoded tolerances

## GOAL STATE
- Regression prevention
- Compatibility assured
- Performance maintained
- Safe refactoring enabled
