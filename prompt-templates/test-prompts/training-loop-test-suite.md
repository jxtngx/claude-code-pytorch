# Training Loop Test Suite

**User Story:**
As a training engineer
I want tests for training loops before implementation
So that I can ensure convergence and optimization correctness

**Prompt:**
"@agent-TestArchitect I need comprehensive tests for a distributed training loop implementation. Write tests that verify loss decreases over iterations, gradients are computed correctly, optimizer steps update parameters, learning rate scheduling works as expected, and checkpointing preserves training state. Use torch.testing to validate tensor operations, torch.distributed tests for multi-GPU scenarios, and performance benchmarks using torch.utils.benchmark. Include tests for gradient accumulation, mixed precision training, and early stopping logic."

## CONSTRAINTS
- Distributed testing: Up to 4 GPUs
- Convergence test: Synthetic data
- State validation: Checkpoint/restore
- Performance: Baseline throughput

## REWARDS
- Loss decrease validation
- Distributed correctness tests
- State preservation checks
- Performance regression detection

## PENALTIES
- No distributed testing
- Missing convergence checks
- Incomplete state validation
- No performance benchmarks

## GOAL STATE
- Training correctness guaranteed
- Distributed behavior validated
- Optimization verified
- Performance baselines set
