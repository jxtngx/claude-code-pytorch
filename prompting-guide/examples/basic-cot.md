# Basic Chain of Thought Example

## Scenario
Selecting the right optimizer for a transformer model training task.

## Without CoT
```markdown
Use Adam optimizer with learning rate 1e-4
```

## With CoT
```markdown
Let's select the optimal optimizer step by step:

1. **Model Architecture Analysis**
   - Transformer with 12 layers
   - 768 hidden dimensions
   - 110M parameters
   - Conclusion: Large model, needs stable optimization

2. **Dataset Characteristics**
   - 50,000 training samples
   - Text sequences, variable length
   - Conclusion: Medium-sized dataset, risk of overfitting

3. **Training Resources**
   - Single GPU with 16GB memory
   - Time budget: 24 hours
   - Conclusion: Need efficient convergence

4. **Optimizer Comparison**
   - SGD: Simple but slow convergence for transformers
   - Adam: Good default, adaptive learning rates
   - AdamW: Adam with weight decay, better generalization
   - LAMB: Good for large batch training

5. **Decision Process**
   - Need adaptive learning rates (rules out SGD)
   - Weight decay important for generalization
   - Not using large batches (rules out LAMB)
   - Conclusion: AdamW is optimal

6. **Hyperparameter Selection**
   - Learning rate: 2e-5 (standard for transformer fine-tuning)
   - Weight decay: 0.01 (prevents overfitting)
   - Warm-up steps: 500 (stable training start)
   - Epsilon: 1e-8 (numerical stability)

**Final Configuration:**
```python
optimizer = torch.optim.AdamW(
    model.parameters(),
    lr=2e-5,
    weight_decay=0.01,
    eps=1e-8
)
```
```

## Benefits Demonstrated

1. **Transparency**: Every decision is justified
2. **Completeness**: No aspect overlooked
3. **Learning**: Others can understand the reasoning
4. **Debugging**: If results are poor, can trace back through logic
5. **Adaptability**: Easy to adjust for different scenarios
